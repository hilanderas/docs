# How to create an instance

Create an instance is very similar between different providers, we will take AWS as an example and illustrate it:
* For enterprise under 5, lowest configuration is recommended, for other number, choose bigger configuration as needed
* Always choose ubuntu 18.04 for instance
* Any way to ssh is OK
