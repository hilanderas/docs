### Step 1: Choose a VPS
We recommend the Amazon Lightsail, Vultr, Linode. The mininal configuration is sufficient. The Bandwidth, Latency, Packet Loss are the primary features you should consider. We prefer amazon Lightsail Singapore and Japan nodes, since the latency is only 50-80ms, while the latency from the same location in Vultr and Linode is 120ms-300ms. Please choos Ubuntu 18.04 server as your operating system.
